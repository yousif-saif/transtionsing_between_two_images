### installing required libraries ###

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the code ###

```
python app.py
```

The program will ask you for two inputs which is the images that the program will use, Enter the images in the following format:
./IMGNAME.IMGFORMAT for example (./harry_potter.png)

and thats it, pretty easy, and you can add your own images in the same directory as the app.py file.

Have a good day!
